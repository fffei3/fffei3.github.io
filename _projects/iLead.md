## Problem
Leaders in Instrument struggle to connect key points of the documents of performance reviews to make the evaluation process collaboratively and efficiently. They also don‘t have an easy-to-use way to give accurate and timely feedback on employees’ achievement and development.

## Approach
Create an effective system to connect key points of the performance review documents and improve the collaboration and efficiency of the evaluation in order to make the process easier for leaders to manipulate.

## Current stakeholders' requirements
* Leaders should be able to review tasks in a clear and actionable way.
* Leaders should be able to take meeting notes on employee self-assessments.
* Leaders need the ability to write and provide insightful feedback to employees.
* Leaders should be allowed to collaborate on performance review and expansion plans.

## Solution
* Provide a real-time and collaborative way to write notes and make comments of employees' review documents
* Ensure leaders have easy access to the review documents and synthesize key information to help them write reviews
* Allow leaders to provide timely feedback based on employee's goal progression and completion

## Use case 1
As a leader, I want to enhance the efficiency of documents review during the leadership meeting, so that all leaders can be more collaborative making highlights and notes during the process and have a thorough understanding of the employees.

## Persona
In order to have a thorough understanding of the group I am designing for. A visualized persona can help me quickly picture my target audience at a glance and think deeply about what they do, think, feel and see in daily life.

## Competitors
Having an overview of the competitive applications in the current marketplace helps me analyze their strengths and weaknesses to find out better solutions for leaders to engage in the performance review process.

## Sketches
I identified the basic structure of each flow and explore the task and requirement linear flow. Make sure users are able to track comments and notes across multiple windows and stages for easy access and recall. Also, I determined the visual hierarchy and layout on each page to ensure the information displayed in a clear and meaningful way.

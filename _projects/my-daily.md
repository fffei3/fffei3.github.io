## Problem
Over 85% of the 3,000 students said that time management is an issue to them.
There is a lot of flexibility with college life. From doing class assignments, having exams to socializing with friends and having a part-time job, college students don?t want to put much time and effort in planning and thinking about their time in daily life.

## Solution
Design a system for college students who feel difficult to organize and balance their time, leveraging their needs and preferences to help them with time management based on a customized plan.

## Goals of the design
**Simply tell the app your goals today**
* Keywords detection of real-time voice input
* Sync your calendar schedule in one platform
* Give personalized suggestions based on the needs

## Competitor research
I did research about some task planning, habit forming products and got some inspirations from them.

## Lo-fi wireframes
The low fidelity wireframes help me identify the optimal framwork of the app and better understand the user behavior on each screen.

## Design decisions

<div class="gallery" data-columns="1">

</div>

1. The chatbot conversation screen allows users to tell their request via voice or keyboard.
2. Users say the goals they want to accomplish today and the system can auto-detect the keywords and create tasks for them.
3. The app will pre-select the tasks that are closer to the due date and prioritize them as urgent tasks.
4. Tasks are divided into different categories which help users quickly identify which one they would like to complete.
5. Users are able to see existing schedules which do not need to set up every day and they can easily unselect one if they don't want to continue doing it.
6. After confirming the goals, the homepage will display all tasks users need to follow on that day and different sizes of chunks show that length of the tasks.
7. The current task will change to bright color and show the progress.
8. If the user clicks into a particular task, it shows timer and let him/her focused on the current task.
9 & 10.  If the user didn't finish the task on time, (s)he can expand the extra time to get things done.
11 & 12. If the user has urgent things to do, it allows him/her add a new task and input basic information in a quick and easy way.

## Takeaways
During the design iterations and getting feedback from classmates, I found out that there is a lot to consider when designing for the voice-based chatbot. 
* The chatbot message sending to users cannot be too long to read at a time, it needs to be short and concise. 
* The language and tone should be read like an actual human so that people feel reliable while using it. 
* The chatbot should indicate clearly what the user needs to do next, otherwise, the user might feel confused and get stuck.
* Because the main function of the chatbot is to help people set up their daily goals easier, so the challenge is to make sure the tasks displayed in a logical way so that can help them quickly identify the ones they want to accomplish today.
